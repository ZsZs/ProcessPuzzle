# ProcessPuzzle
ProcessPuzzle is a platform for content management and business workflow based applications. For more details see [the ProcessPuzzle website](https://processpuzzle.com). 

This repository is so called Monorepository and contains a couple of libraries, which can be useful even independently from the platform.
- [Util](/libs/util/README.md) => generic purpose functions, useful at building Angular applications
- [Base Entity](/libs/base-entity/README.md) => Angular Material Table and Reactive Form generator base on Entity Definition.
- [CI/CD](/.github/README.md) pipeline for all containing building blocks.
